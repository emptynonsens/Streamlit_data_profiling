# Streamlit data profiling

[Deployed app link](https://share.streamlit.io/emptynonsens/streamlit_data_profiling/main)

Streamlit app made for quick statystical analysis of data. 
App uses several [seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data) datasets. 

App uses [pandas_profiling](https://github.com/ydataai/pandas-profiling) which is a data explanatory python library and [streamlit pandas profiling](https://pypi.org/project/streamlit-pandas-profiling) which allows streamlit to embed the report. 

Enjoy the app.
